[% SET title = 'The Weekend' %]

A few of the troops are coming down early to spend some time in Cornwall and
help out with a couple of things before the wedding. We are hoping to enjoy a
bit of time with you all before we jet off and leave you to enjoy the beautiful
scenery without us.

Possible events will include a BBQ at the cottage where the Nicholson
contingent are taking residence, some time at the beach if the weather is up to
it and church on Sunday morning with lunch together afterwards.

Let us know when you will be around and keep in touch so we can make the most
of seeing you all. We will aim to put any definite plans on the website nearer
the time so watch this space!

If anyone still wants to sort out accommodation, get in touch. We will be able
to recommend various local places and if you are coming for the weekend only, a
number of friends have offered their spare rooms.
