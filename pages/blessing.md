[% SET title = 'The Blessing: June 16th' %]

As we are unable to invite all the people we would love to, and we understand
that Cornwall is a bit too much of a trek for some of you, we are also having a
blessing of our marriage in Nottingham on June 16th. 

It will be a short blessing as part of the Family Service. There is no need to
get dressed up!  We simply want to be able to share with as many as you as we
can, particularly those from Musters Road who have been such a support to us
(especially Vic) and praying for us over the recent months.

There will be an open house and buffet throughout the afternoon, hopefully with
some wedding photos to show you! Just pop in for as much or as little time as
you can manage. We appreciate that it is also Father’s Day so please don’t feel
obliged to change any of your plans.
