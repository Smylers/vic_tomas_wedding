[% SET title = 'Prayer Requests' %]

Thank you so much to everyone who has been praying for us over recent months.
It means so much to us to have this kind of support and feels like such a great
foundation for our marriage.

We thought it would be nice to share a few things with you as it gets closer to
the big day so that we will continue to be surrounded in prayer.

Firstly we have just moved house and would love prayer as we try to unpack,
organise, decorate and settle in. We were aiming to get one upstairs and one
downstairs room completed by May but we will have to see how it goes!  We are
also hugely thankful for the great number of blessings we have received in the
way of furniture, tools, firewood and help with moving.

We started the marriage preparation course at Kea on the 19th February.
Please pray for us as we discuss potentially difficult topics but also grow
together and prepare for married life.
