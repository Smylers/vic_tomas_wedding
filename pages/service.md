[% SET title = 'The Service' %]

We are so pleased to be getting married at Kea. We have both been attending
regularly for over a year now and have recently moved into the parish. It
really feels like our church family and feels like the perfect place to
celebrate and prepare for our life together.

The service starts at 2.00pm

Vic is unlikely to be fashionably late as she will not be able to contain her
excitement any longer than is absolutely necessary!

We are very excited that there will be lots of children at the wedding. We love
excitement, spontaneous laughter and random announcements at comedy moments so
please do not be at all worried about noise or running about â€” this applies to
adults too if you feel so inclined :)

After the service we will be having Cornish cream tea. For the foreigners
amongst you it is important to point out that this involves putting jam on the
scone first and then the cream on top. This is very different to a Devon cream
tea where the cream goes on first and quite frankly makes no sense! There will
also be Yorkshire Tea for those of you feeling a bit lost!

Please hang about if you can, to meet the rest of our family and friends. We
will be having some photographs after the service and would love to have one of
everyone there, so no hiding! 

Biodegradable confetti will be provided so there is no need to bring any.
