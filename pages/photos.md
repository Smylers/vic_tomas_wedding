[% SET title = 'Photos' %]

We’d love it if you would share any photos you take of our wedding.

So we’ve set up a Flickr group for this, so everybody can see everybody else’s
photos in one handy place, at
<a href=http://www.flickr.com/groups/tomasandvictoria/>www.flickr.com/groups/tomasandvictoria/</a>.

Flickr is a photo sharing website that's part of Yahoo! It’s free to join and
to upload your photos. Please join our group on the above link, then add your
photos to the ‘group pool’.
