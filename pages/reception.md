[% SET title = 'The Reception' %]

Vic has had a picnic wedding planned since about the age of 8!!

We are praying that the weather will allow outdoor games and true picnic spirit
but there is plenty of space available inside if we need to revert to
plan&nbsp;B (very probable in Cornwall)  so do not fear! We hope that there
will be a few fun surprises to keep you all entertained. Ideally it would be
advisable to wear shoes suitable for grass and warm outer layers.

All food and drink will be provided (despite the fact that when Vic suggested a
picnic wedding, Tomas thought it meant that everyone brought a packed lunch!).

There will be a teddybearâ€™s picnic as well if anyone wishes to bring along a
friend, with a prize for the best dressed bear.
